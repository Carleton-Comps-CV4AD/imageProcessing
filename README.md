#Image Processing
This conatains 3 scripts. 

usingCurve.py is a rendition of how to apply a photoshop curve to images. 
See the annotatedCurve.jpeg file for more details on how exactly to translate a curve into the code.

The other 2 scripts are applications of usingCurve.py, one usings an odgt file to point to the images that want to be deweathered,
and the other by pointing to a folder with the images. Simply fill in the correct directories and run the python file 
(for example: python3 imageManipulation.py)
